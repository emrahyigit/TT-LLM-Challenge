# TT-LLM-Challenge

## Description
This Python code reads the contents of a PDF menu that contains images and categorizes them. It uses optical character recognition (OCR) to extract the text from the images and then applies a categorization algorithm to group the menu items based on their type (e.g., appetizers, main courses, desserts). The code provides an efficient and automated way to analyze and organize menus, making it easier to search for specific items or generate reports based on menu categories.
